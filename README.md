# Accessibility Quiz

Part of freeCodeCamp's *Responsive Web Design* curriculum. Recaps recommended ways to approach forms, and touched on some tips for accessibility e.g. semantic html and ARIA attributes. There were a few instances where I had to reach for an external CSS reference because the project assumed knowledge of things that haven't been introduced yet.
