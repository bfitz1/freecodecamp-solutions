            <h2>We Get Bowling Balls</h2>
            <p>Bingcraft was founded by a shadowy cabal of bowling artisans, honing their craft
               for years in full neglect of the many other facets of their lives.
               We've spared no expense anywhere, except for only everywhere our financial
               advisors said we couldn't be held liable in a court of law.
            </p>
            <h2>We Get You</h2>
            <p>Money and time is valuable, so that's why we think you should be able to
               spend as much or as little as you think you need to get the experience
               you want. From penny pinchers to dollar deadbeats, we've got you covered.
            </p>
            <h2>Do You Get Us?</h2>
            <p>If you do, good! If you don't, catch up: </p>

                <p>As functional as can be with gratuitous corner cutting.
                   Rugged and economical, but not in a fashionable way that makes socialites like you.
                   You either don't think highly of yourself or this activity.</p>
