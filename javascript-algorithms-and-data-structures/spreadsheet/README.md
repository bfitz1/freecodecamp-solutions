# Spreadsheet

A part of freeCodeCamp's *JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures* course. Applying much of what was introduced in earlier lessons. Although, this one had more techniques that you'd see in functional programming (e.g. currying).

There were also some kinda gnarly regular expressions, but I suppose the alternative would be diving into more sophisticated techniques for parsing. And who's got time for that?
