# Survey Form

Part of freeCodeCamp's *Responsive Web Design* curriculum. I took what I've learned from the previous lessons to create a survey form on my own. It passed all the tests, so it's good enough for me to call Doneâ„¢.

The CSS is pretty thrown together, as it wasn't really part of the project.
